A few years ago Turkey's inflation was where the UK is now. Their central bank failed to hike rates enough, and now they have inflation at 70% and 15% interest rates. I don't think this scenario will be allowed to happen in the UK - if it comes to it, the BoE will put economic stability ahead of house prices. \n",

If there's a recession and rising rates but inflation still stays high, then there will be the uncomfortable prospect of continuing to raise rates into the recession. But the BoE expects the recession to bring unemployment up to 5.5%, which will reduce salary inflation. There are lots of unknowns - what if we have a recession but still have a worker shortage so salaries growth doesn't fall enough, what if the price of oil/gas continues to go up even in a recession, due to supply constraints, like war, sanctions, etc.\n",

Two kids went through private school (my sister from aged 7, me from aged 13). My older brother didn’t go to private school. My parents have always driven nice cars (mercs/audi etc but nothing like a 911 or Austin Martin). We used to go on one abroad holiday a year and one in the UK. We would go on quite a few day trips like national trust etc and could eat out weekly. \n",

That’s an ok salary in the north of England, though certainly won’t make you particularly wealthy, even less so if your wife isn’t earning and/or you have kids. Housing costs in the UK are generally quite high and the global inflation and energy issues aren’t helping matters. Petrol is double the price of the US currently (and would previously have been a lot more than that but you’ll at least benefit from the exchange rate of the weaker pound sterling at the moment).\n",

      "This is in theory true, however there are some other things to consider:\n",

      "1. The main mechanism by which workers can demand higher wages and cause this wage-price spiral is unions. Unions are historically weak at the moment so this mechanism isn't really working.\n",
      "2. We have had decades of poor real wage growth in the UK. The cost of living is already very high. If you're not going to increase wages to deal with this inflation, when *are* you going to increase wages to tackle the high cost of living? Employers don't increase wages when inflation is low...\n",
      "3. If wages are low and prices are high, where has the difference gone? In a closed loop system, that money has gone into profits. Rather than yet again fixing the economy off the backs of the poorest, the government could do more to tackle obscene wealth and profits, either through taxation or through capping prices.\n",
      "---\n",
      "Higher wages means more money flowing into the economy. Right now, from a personal perspective \"higher wages cause inflation\" has the same energy as \"nobody wants to work\" and \"women won't date nice guys\". I invest in markets quite a lot and most of my savings go there. Quite honestly my days off are spent looking at financial statements and I know that gross &amp; net margins have gone up.  It isn't really about Russia, supply chain issues etc. in most industries, it's mostly because businesses have an excuse to jack up prices without being seen as the villain. It's common in a lot of industries where you have 2 years of prices going up and then 8-10 years of almost no increase. \n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, the elec &amp; gas price spike is pure nonsense because the UK imports of Russian oil &amp; gas are very low and easily replaceable especially nearing summer when you honestly don't need your heating to be on 24/7. That being said if companies can increase margins and blame it on Russia they certainly will hence the artificial cost of living crisis. Workers demanding more like the min wage being raised from 9.5 to 10 wouldn't have much of an impact imho. Most of them are asking for it in order to deal with higher living costs. Either way the money ends up more into the pockets of essential businesses and associated shareholders. That money doesn't flow out as quickly as most of it is locked into new investments focused on growth that can take 3-5 years to materialize.\n",
      "\n",
      "My 2 pence on this being on both sides of the coin is that the price hikes need to stop first or else it's going to create an even bigger divide between the top 1% and bottom 80%, which if history is right can only end in civil unrest.\n",

      "This is a simplified explanation but illustrates the two impacts wage increases have.\n",
      "\n",
      "The best reduction of inflation to a single line is \"too much money chasing too few goods\". Inflation is usually associated by extremely high aggregate demand when an economy is growing rapidly, but in some cases (like now) it can also happen if the aggregate supply of goods and services has shrunk.\n",
      "\n",
      "A combination of the impact of covid on supply chains, oil/gas shortages, and a large decrease in the population of working Europeans in the UK has reduced supply significantly. As a result we've ended up with some spectacular inflation numbers, which will probably keep climbing as commodities and food are likely to see worsening shortages over the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, increasing wages has an impact on both demand and supply. The demand side is easier to understand, if you pay people more you'll increase demand, which makes the imbalance between supply and demand worse, leading to additional inflation.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the supply side increasing wages without increasing productivity will reduce aggregate supply, as the cost of providing goods/services increases. If you want to think of this on a company basis then you'd say that companies will have to increase their prices to break even. Obviously in the long run companies can't run at a loss, and bankruptcies can reduce supply further temporarily.\n",
      "\n",
      "The really big problem here, and the issue the BoE is concerned about, is that this can turn into a vicious cycle, where inflation leads workers to demand pay rises, which further fuels inflation, and so on. Extremely high inflation is regarded as a very bad thing for understandable reasons, which leads to the sort of comments made by BoE staff here.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd like to point out that these comments aren't a value judgement on the merits of any one individual receiving a pay rise. Rather, it's recognising the fact that in aggregate these pay increases can worsen inflation.\n",

      "No it hasnt. QE directly causes inflation. More money chasing the same amount of goods and services.  The federal reserve in America printed 80% of all dollars in existence in 2020.  Massive QE just like the UK.\n",

      "UK debt and unfunded pension liabilities is about 11-12 trillion GBP. With 30m people in work that's about £400,000 per worker in addition to the cost of keeping the Government running. Governments that reduce spending get booted out, so the only solution is to deflate this debt (which is pegged to CPI) with real inflation in excess of CPI. I would not trust CPI.\n",
      "---\n",
      "Wage inflation is linked to more usual inflation, BUT, it is dangerous because we live in a global economy, and if we incur higher wage inflation it makes the production of those things cost more, which means we become less competitive against other nations who's costs are lower.  That is the primary danger with wage inflation.\n",

      "So the real issue with fuel price becomes inflation, which as I’m sure you’ve seen is currently out of control. Subsidising fuel purchase would only make this worse. You may think this is heartless, but the alternatives are much worse. By passing on the cost to consumers, it encourages consumers to cut down energy consumption. This is an important part of controlling inflation which is pretty much entirely driven by energy crisis. The alternative option to cut inflation is increase interest rates, which is also happening but again, can drive UK to recession and have even more of an impact on people’s finances than fuel. \n",
      "\n",

The crisis with climate change is not an existential one therefore, it is a social one. \n",

      "While I can’t comment on the housing stuff, I can give you a very limited insight into investing. Inflation is high right now, and interest rates are zero. What that means is that the money big companies would usually have in bonds, is now invested in company stocks with good long term prospects, which means they are overpriced (your teslas, your apples, etc.). If you want to invest in a high inflation scenario, I would look at companies which have competitive advantages over their competitors. I’m talking your Coca Cola, your apple, NVIDIA, so on. Again, they are over priced right now, so you have to look for a good entry point (wait for a significant drop in stock price then buy). I think the biggest mistake you can make is in investments is impulse buying because you feel your money is losing value. \n",

      "Another course of action is dividend investment, where you buy shares of companies who pay you back some of their earnings. Dividend payment is a solid sign the company is well established and the owners trust it to move forward and grow the next few years. High dividend companies tend to pay 3-6% of the money you invested in them throughout the year, so the idea is you invest a bit every month and reinforce your position. If recession scares you, consider doing dividend investment across several markets! You can do a bit in the US, a bit in the UK, a bit in Europe, etc. China has really good companies but eh, kinda scary right now \n",

       "  'body': 'If you want to see the market expectations for future rates, you can google for the forward interest rate curve. \\n \\nThe 10-30 year part of the curve is 0.8-1.2% (this is SONIA, which is an overnight rate for interbank lending, it is a \"risk-free\" benchmark though). This is up quite significantly in the past year, but no-one is projecting 10% interest rates any time soon.  \\n\\nDoes this mean that it is impossible? No. Forward rates are just an estimate of expectations from a point of time, they are usually wrong because things happen. But right now, it looks reasonable to me.  \\n\\nBut if energy prices stay high because of some war, and if we are unable to solve labour shortages (which seems quite possible given that unemployment is still quite high) then you could see inflation stick around. If that does occur, then we will need substantially higher rates for a long period...probably above 5%. But, right now, it looks transitory (the US is an example of a country where it does not look to be transitory...inflation is going to cause real trouble for some countries).',\n",

       "  'body': \"You have a few different options. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThere's cash, rates on which could range from around 0.6% for easy access, to 2-3% for regular saver accounts where you pay in a regular monthly amount. You'll have the security of the FSCS guarantee and the certainty of cash, but you're risking your money losing value vs inflation\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThere's investing, likely best to start using a Stocks and Shares ISA - bunch of providers for these ranging from your bank/building society to other providers like HL or Vanguard. You have the potential to grow your money more than cash and hopefully inflation, particularly over the longer-term, but you also incur fees for investments and a risk of loss if you need access to the money at a time what you're invested in has gone down in value, since investments will fluctuate in value. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe other option I'd consider is premium bonds. You get ultimate safety because the value is guaranteed by HM Treasury on any money held with NS&amp;I, but like cash you risk your money losing value vs inflation, with the chance of winning various prizes instead of interest (1% 'average rate of return' but many will get nothing as prizes aren't guaranteed). \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nUnless you have a long-term goal you want to save the money for (in 5+ years, or you want to put it aside for retirement), cash/premium bonds might be a better option. Ultimately depends what you decide you want that £50 a month to be for and what risks you want to take as to the best option for you.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nOn the point re Lifetime ISAs and saving for a house deposit - you have both cash and investment options for these too, so if that's a product you're interested in the above distinctions will still apply. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHope that's helpful!\",\n",

Keep in mind that house price growth right now (10%) is ahead of CPI (5.5%) which is ahead of interest rates (0.25%). \\n\\nSo what matters isn't any one number, *it's the difference between them*. \\n\\nSo you could have interest rates at 10%, but I suspect fiat would be crashing so you'd have CPI at 15% and house prices at 20%. In which case it would be very beneficial to have large property debts, as they'd be inflating away in real terms. \\n\\nWe had it in the 90s with rated briefly hitting 17%. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWhat you need to worry about is your mortgage payments and your salary. If you're on a fixed rate and your house price is rocketing, that's great. Although it's bad news for your salary since that will be stagnating while everyday goods get more expensive. Or if you're on a variable rate or a first time buyer, you're gonna have to pay prices that reflect inflation.\",\n",

       "  'body': \"&gt;What do you think should be done to combat the estimated sharp rise?\\n\\nI cannot think of a solution in the near term. Energy is a global free market, we're exposed to prices that we have no control over. \\n\\nIn the long run, we need a lot more domestic supply, meaning renewables, power storage (check out vanadium flow batteries) and nuclear. But that's gonna be years before it hits the grid. \\n\\nIn the short run, we could subsidise energy production/bills, but it's all taxpayer money and it leaves the country in exchage for gas, so it comes out our pocket one way or another. Likely through inflation or reduced budget elsewhere. \\n\\nThere's gonna be huge knock-on effects to our economy. Businesses are going to face even higher operating costs, and customers will be cutting back on spending. It's yet another hit to them after Covid and Brexit. \\n\\nHell, even water and sewage uses a percent or two of our national energy supply, so water bills are gonna be increasing significantly. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHonestly, I think the best we could do at this point is for the government to admit it's powerless to influence global gas supply, and to explicitly warn the citizens of the UK that no help is coming. \\n\\nBetter to tell people the truth and give them as much warning as possible, than give them a false sense of security until the first big bill arrives...\",\n",

       "  'body': \"There are various fiddles that keep the official CPI artificially low. For example, they're allowed to substitute items that are equivalent, so if Colgate toothpaste goes up in price, they can switch to measuring the value of Lidl toothpaste. They also discount items that are getting better - for example TVs are getting higher definition, so the ONS argues that you get more TV for the same money and adds an adjustment factor to the price. \\n\\nYou also have factors like Jack Monroe was arguing recently - basic items in supermarket appear to have inflated significantly faster than the mid-range ones in the ONS basket. So the poorest people may actually be seeing a much higher inflation rate than the middle classes. \\n\\nYou also have the fact it's expensive being poor. From pre-payment energy meters to crappy cars that break down to job insecurity, none of that shows up in the ONS stats. \\n\\nIMHO property inflation is significantly undervalued too, as it assumed you can just rent a rat-infested bedit all your life. I think we should be measuring the cost of buying a modest family house, which has risen significantly faster than inflation. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo I'm the same as you. The ONS figures are something like 5.4%. My actual personal inflation - as someone that wants to live in an owned home and live to the same standard that my parents had - is significantly more.\",\n",

       "  'body': '&gt; Surely Vanguard is just selling a bunch of products that people will buy? Financial advisors and books like Smarter Investing say you should have some percentage of bonds in your portfolio, Vanguard sell a set of portfolios-in-a-box with various percentages of bonds for you to choose.\\n\\nVanguard itself also run active strategies (or rather, strategies which are more what you\\'d expect to be active - passive strategies still have elements of decision of course, whether that\\'s by the investor or by the index compilers, or by the managers as to how to do the day to day), but if you mean LS itself, then it\\'s about what underlying components they are going to use to get the desired exposure (the fund is not managed to a benchmark).\\n\\nI expect they have some models as to that.\\n\\n&gt; Is it your position that these are bad products for retail investors?\\n\\nNo, that\\'s a binary evaluation which I don\\'t accept when it comes to this kind of thing. There is a spectrum of investment decisions and you also have to take into account the idiosyncrasies of the investor - whether that\\'s a tendency to fiddle, or impatience, or liquidity (i.e. no lockups).\\n\\nThese kinds of products I think are fine. Not amazing, but not going to be fatal to one\\'s financial future. It will probably not be optimal in hindsight, but hindsight can\\'t capture things like panic or fiddling. It\\'s good enough for the effort, time, and safety, in the sense, that the investor can\\'t do too much damage to it.\\n\\n&gt; Is there any chance you could dumb this down for me a bit, and explain it like I\\'m 5?\\n\\n&gt; I infer you\\'re saying that inflationary pressures and interest rates will make the market a lot more volatile in the coming year or years, and that retail investors will find this emotionally or psychologically challenging?\\n\\n&gt; Are you saying that retail investors would benefit from buying options to reduce the volatility of their portfolios?\\n\\nYes, I think that many retail investors - hell even professional managers (as there is a wide, wide spectrum of ability there) - will simply not know what to do when faced with inflationary pressures and its impact across markets. I think a long spell where a portfolio is underwater or down, will be psychologically challenging for many, especially younger investors. I fear whether they will stick to it, or fiddle - or for instance, stop investing altogether. Well, if I cared too much about other people\\'s portfolios.\\n\\nIn theory, options may operate as a hedge. In practice, they won\\'t for retail investors, as they will not know how to size or price the position properly and will still wonder why they do it as the portfolio still suffers losses and then we\\'re back to \"what should I do now\" and that trauma.\\n\\nOf course, if you\\'re going to ask me, what should they buy, I don\\'t have a good answer for that. I think for many retail investors you\\'re basically committed now and there will be red, either in nominal terms or through inflation, so ultimately you\\'re going to be looking very hard again at your time horizons before thinking what to do.',\n",

You now earn £55,000, so you *would* be paying back your loan based on the £35,000 that you get above the threshold, which would mean an increase to your payments. But usually the threshold increases each year too, so it might go up to £25,000 meaning that you're back repaying based on the fact that you're only earning £30,000 over the threshold, so your payments stay as they were last year.\\n\\nWell now the threshold isn't moving up, so as your wage increases so do your repayments as you earn more and more above the threshold.\\n\\n*Those numbers are entirely fictional.*  \\n*Not everyone gets an annual pay rise, but we're talking generally across the population.*\",\n",

Just loading more debt into the economy. An extra £40 a year for the next five years.\\nAlso, why £200 per electricity bill? Is it just for the political soundbite? Why not something proportionate like a penny or two per unit?\\n\\nThe £150 council tax rebate is poorly targeted. Plenty of wealthy households in band D who don't 'need' this gift of public money. Plenty of poorer households who won't see it - students for example, those who already don't pay council, also a significant number of renters who don't pay their council tax directly so the land lord will just pocket it. Also, most of this rebate will be eaten up in council tax rises! Also remember that underlying rates are still rising so while this £150 give away will hold bill down this year in 2023 we will experience a big jump as two years worth of increase hit home and no rebate. Could be ~£300 more than 2022?\\n\\nNothing on VAT - despite these higher bills delivering a windfall to treasury. Nothing on windfall tax despite oil majors raking in £billions in additional profits, ExxonMobil's share price up 45% in 5 months.\\n\\n...and BoE telegraphs inflation will exceed 7% and interest rate will continue to rise.\\n...and NI hike.\\n...and income tax threshold's frozen (particularly harmful as inflation picks up).\",\n",

I don\\'t think any of the fundamental issues with the housing market are going away any time soon, and if the market \"cools\" in coming years it will be because asking prices have risen to better reflect final sales prices. In addition to house price increases, you\\'re also currently spending money on rent. And then there\\'s the non-financial side of homeownership - i.e. if you\\'re anything like me, not having to deal with landlords or letting agents is pretty high on the list of reasons to want to buy!\\n\\nBut to answer your actual question, I\\'m afraid there is no good risk-free option. Obviously in normal times interest rates would be a bit closer to the rate of inflation (and we still might see slight increases in interest rates, and a slight decrease in inflation) but cash savings always loses out to inflation to some extent. You can get fixed savers that pay more than premium bonds (based on average luck) but the rates are still pretty dire.',\n",

       "  'body': \"Yeah I wouldn't consider this myself. Judging by some recent posts on this sub, I think quite a few folks are going to really hurt themselves by getting into investments over radically too short timeframes because they see it as a panacea to the declining value of cash in inflationary environments. What they forget is that periods of high inflation are typically not good for equities either, so much so that the educated and informed projections I've seen expect stunted and uneven returns on the market over the next decade, let alone over a period of a mere year and a half. Probably the least mentioned yet most reliable hedge against inflation is that the price of labour power gets more expensive too, meaning you either receive or at least can bargain for higher wages, though a discussion of that is perhaps beyond the permitted purview of this sub.\",\n",

Your accrued pension after 5 years will be more than £4979.

The difference between career average and final salary pensions is why Tube Drivers are getting an 8% pay rise this year and Civil Servants are getting 3%. That's also why final salary is better than career average: in final salary both your pension and your salary are increasing with inflation; in career average your pension is increasing with inflation, but your salary most probably isn't.\n",

So to get up to that £10k per year, the private employer would be needing to pay £6,082 per year into the pension. That's the equivalent of a 14% employer contribution based on current salary, probably not likely, so instead a chunk of that £6k needs to come from an increased salary.

      "The first thing to know is that there is almost ***no*** point putting that money into a bank or savings account. The interest rates are so low at the moment that you will make *very* little as a return.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, *investing* that money might be the best idea for you - this is where we start getting into FTSE/All Cap/Vanguard, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "The common advice on this sub is to open up a Stocks &amp; Shares (S&amp;S) ISA with Vanguard: [https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/investing-explained/stocks-shares-isa](https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/investing-explained/stocks-shares-isa)\n",
      "\n",
      "A S&amp;S ISA is just like a bank account, except you money is invested in the stock market for you, so isn't just reliant on the interest rates, but rather on how well the investment performs. This means you can get a much better return on your money. The other difference to a bank account is that you're only allowed to put in up to £20k/year. But, any interest you make is *not* taxed. So if you grow your £20k into £25k, that £5k difference is all yours, none of it goes to the tax man.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, with a S&amp;S ISA, you can choose where you want your money invested. You can generally choose individual stocks or fund, or go for an 'index'. An index is a special fund that is very well diversified and aims to 'track' the overall performance of a market. This ultimately means that it'll generally be more stable than an individual stock, but may not grow quite as fast. But, it's one of the best things to use for someone who's just starting in investing and wants to be 'passive' - ie, doesn't want to have to spend hours monitoring and managing your stocks/shares. You can just invest in an index and leave it alone for years and most will give a reasonable return - the rule of thumb is around 7-8%/year, but that can of course vary year to year.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a Vanguard ISA, they offer their FTSE Global All-Cap Index. [https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/investments/vanguard-ftse-global-all-cap-index-fund-gbp-acc?intcmpgn=equityglobal\\_ftseglobalallcapindexfund\\_fund\\_link](https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/investments/vanguard-ftse-global-all-cap-index-fund-gbp-acc?intcmpgn=equityglobal_ftseglobalallcapindexfund_fund_link)\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't worry about the name - FTSE is just the \"Financial Times Stock Exchange\", a large stock market. Global means that it covers stocks from all over the world, which is what you want as events in individual countries should not majorly impact the fund. \"All Cap\" just means that it invests in a wide range of areas, so for example, not just technology or oil, but a diverse group of areas, again so that you don't have \"all your eggs in one basket\". And \"Index\" means it tracks the market as I explained above.\n",
      "\n",
      " So, the best thing you can do if you've worked through the flow chart is open a Vanguard ISA based on their FTSE Global All-Cap Index and get £20k in. If you do that ***NOW*** you'll be able to get £20k in before the end of the current tax year (31st March), then in April you can get another £20k for the 2022/3 tax year - DO NOT waste your ISA allowance for this tax year if you haven't used it. It's worth just getting £20k in before April even if you're not sure how to invest the rest for now.\n",
      "\n",
      "As you can only get £20k/year into an ISA, it would take many years for you to get the whole £200k in. However, that's not a problem. You can take out a general account with Vanguard and put as much as you want in: [https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/investing-explained/general-investment-account](https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/investing-explained/general-investment-account)\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem with a general account is that you're eligible for tax on profits from this. So, what you can do is get the rest of your money into this account so that it's making a return for you, then every tax year just transfers £20k into your ISA so that you're making it as tax efficient as possible. You'll likely end up paying a small amount of tax on your general account, but your return will still be much better than leaving it in a bank/savings account (where any interest is also taxed).\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, finally onto your question \"Is there an option where I can stick it and take a monthly interest payment every month\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This really depends on your requirements for what your want out of monthly interest payments and your long term goals in general.\n",

      "If you invest in the FTSE Global All-Cap Index, let's say you'll average the rule of thumb 7% return? That's around £14k/year.\n",

      "So, could you take that £14k out each year? Sure, if that's what you wanted to do. Could you take out the interest each month? Sure. But you shouldn't! This is where you need to understand the concept of *compound interest.*\n",
      "\n",
      "At a 7% return, if you invested just the £200k and *no more monthly payments*, then in the first month you'd likely earn around £1,166. Not bad right? Sure, you could take that out if you wanted to, which would leave you back with £200k in the fund and then next month it might make another £1166 and you could keep doing that if you wanted too, but your portfolio will never grow above that £200k - and that might be absolutely fine for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, if you leave that £1166 in your account, you now what £201,166, your 'interest' is reinvested in the fund and the next month you might make £1173 of 'interest'. Then that gets reinvested and the next month you make £1180 of interest - do you see where this is going? You start making interest on your interest! This is called *compound interest* and is very important to growing your money. \n",
      "\n",
      "The difference between £1166 and £1173 doesn't sound a lot, and you might ask is it worth it for less than £10/month? That's where you then need to look long term. Any investment should be treated as long term, and in your first year you might make around £14k of interest, but after 10 years, you'll be making around £27k of interest/year, and your total interest earned will be somewhere around £200k meaning you'll have pretty much doubled your original investment! \n",
      "\n",
      "If you took the interest out every month and didn't use compound interest, then you'd make around £135k of interest over the 10 years, but letting it compound, you'll make an extra £65k. So again, it's completely down to what you want out of your investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a mid-ground here too. If you work on an approx 7% return, then you can take 3-4% out of your fund each year which will leave 3-4% of the interest in there to compound. Of course it won't grow at the same rate though.\n",

As a species we have grown to a population of 8 billion, and we've already exploited all the cheapest, easiest to access sources of commodities that we need (fossil fuels, steel, copper, etc.). Over time it gets harder and more expensive to extract new resources, and we need to develop new technologies to keep up. So far we managed, but there may soon come a point where world demand for natural resources begins to significantly exceed the world supply capacity. At that time, you'll see things like non-linear changes in pricing (by which I mean that a small change in demand, say 3% rise in gas demand during a cold winter, could result in a 15% increase in prices).\n",

Yes, short-dated bonds will be among the least volatile of funds that you could choose from, but I see no reason why you would choose those over just plain old cash. The returns on short-dated bond funds would likely be so low as to be comparable to interest rates on cash savings accounts, except with the bond fund you risk getting less out than what you put in. (And by the way, those rising interest rates that you expect would actually decrease the value of your bond holding -- prices fall as yields rise.) With a 60% allocation to the bond fund anyway (which would only increase as you approach the end of your timeline), why not just use cash savings?

      "Well in order to demonstrate it you have to look at the precise terms of the DB scheme being discussed, because they don't all accrue benefits in quite the same way. I'm basing what I'm saying on the NHS pension because that's the one I'm in and the one I understand best - but generally speaking the public sector schemes are broadly similar. I'll do my best to explain it, but fair warning - this is probably going to be a long read!\n",
      "\n",
      "Essentially the key point to grasp is that your benefits in a DB scheme are almost entirely disconnected from what you pay in, because the **benefit** is defined, rather than the contribution - hence the name. This is a bit counter-intuitive because it feels like the more you pay in, the more you should get out - but this isn't necessarily the case. The simplest example of this in the NHS scheme for example is that [your contribution is determined by your full-time equivalent income](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/member-hub/cost-being-scheme), whereas your [benefit is determined by your actual gross earnings](https://www.wesleyan.co.uk/pensions-and-retirement/nhs-pension/guide) - so if you work part time on a higher salary you can actually end up paying more and get less back than someone who worked full time earning a lot less than you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you grasp this concept that the benefit is disconnected from the contribution though, it becomes easier to understand why a DB scheme does not automatically beat a DC one - and crucially why comparing employer contributions between them is an apples to oranges comparison.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the NHS scheme, members accrue 1/54 of their gross annual pay in benefits, so if you earned £25,000 you would accrue £463/year in benefits. This is then uplifted every year by CPI + 1.5%. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you were in a DC scheme with the same % contributions however, you'd pay 7.1% personally plus a whopping [20.68% employer contribution](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/nhs-pension-scheme-employer-contribution-rates-202223) for an enormous £6945 total pension contribution. Now it isn't quite as bad as it looks, because that £463 accrued benefit actually refers to what you will receive **per year** when you retire, so generally speaking you can multiply this by 20 because you expect to live 20 years in retirement. £463*20 = £9260, plus you get that +1.5% per year above inflation. Obviously if you expect to die before 88 (current age for NHS pension without actuarial reduction is 68) this changes the picture, and how much of a difference that annual 1.5% is going to make is determined by your age, but hopefully you get the point - the DB scheme now looks better because it delivers that guaranteed income in retirement.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's not all rosey in the DB garden though, particularly for someone who is young:\n",
      "\n",
      "Someone who is 25 earning that £25,000 in a year in the NHS scheme gets £463/year in benefits from that year, then by 68 this is worth £882/year or £17642 assuming they collect it to age 88. \n",
      "\n",
      "Someone who is 25 and earns the same £25,000 in year in a DC scheme with the same contribution rates gets £6945 cash to invest. If they invest it and get 5% returns over the next 43 years they end up with a stonking £59356.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, why are DB schemes so well-regarded? Well, the first reason is because they used to be even better and people still think they are as good as they were, when they aren't. Just look at the terms of the 1995 and 2008 NHS schemes to see why - the 2015 scheme has been nerfed in a big way. \n",
      "\n",
      "That's not to say the 2015 scheme isn't worth staying in though - for a start that CPI + 1.5% means you get a guaranteed return. As the example above demonstrates, if you were somehow able to get a DC scheme with comparable contribution rates you *might* come out on top by a pretty big margin - but you may also lose out significantly as well. More than that though, if you only look at the employee contribution in isolation DB schemes are *usually* a pretty good deal - with the caveat that you will be paying more than most of your DC peers. \n",

Still sounds a bit crap for the DB scheme, but as I explained above that £463 is **per year**. So if we do the same comparison as before with a more realistic DC contribution rate:\n",

      "Looks like an easy win for the NHS scheme there, but remember the NHS employee is paying 7.1% of gross whereas the NEST employee is only paying 5% of their auto-enrolment earnings.

You're in your mid 20s, if you were to stick in the same job for 40 years you'll be able to retire on £40k per year guaranteed until the day you die, even if you live to 100+.

      "A big disadvantage of the Alpha scheme is the retirement date, which is pinned to the state pension age (68 for you currently). If you want to retire early, you have to take a reduction (ignore the scare stories about penalties of about 5% per year, it's not really that bad, it's a reduction to take account of the fact you'd be claiming your pension for longer, just spreading the monthly payment further rather than penalising you for retiring early). A SIPP or LISA can be withdrawn much earlier, so depending on your retirement plans you might want to open one. Be wary that a SIPP will contribute to your [Lifetime Allowance](https://www.civilservicepensionscheme.org.uk/planning-for-retirement/lifetime-allowance-lta/). Read your annual pension statement to see how this is calculated, but the gist is take the LTA (currently £1.07m), deduct any SIPP or other private pension balances, then divide by 20. If your pension payout amount is going to be above £53k per year (and by the looks of things at your age and salary already, you're only a promotion or two away from doing that), you'd have to pay additional tax. In which case, saving in a LISA instead (or retiring early) would avoid that.\n",

I was on a similar income and moved from a 3 bed (2 and a office then nursery) terraced worth about £240k when we sold, to a 5 bed detached with a big garden and about double the size which we bought for £540k.  But to do this we also moved from a city with a 2 mile walk to centre to a town 20 miles away which was 20min to 1 hour drive away. But that was part of the reasoning as moving from a city to a more rural place with kids appealed to us. \n",

      "-\tbills also went up as more house to heat\n",
      "-\tobviously the mortgage was significantly more (in reality we overstretched ourselves)\n",

      "Financial impact\n",
      "-\tMy income has gone up more than inflation so the affordability theoretically got easier with time\n",
      "-\tThe big win for us is the value of the house, this has increased way more than inflation. So on a financial basis it was great and the same growth on a much bigger house means more money as a return. \n",
      "-\tThis was always part of my plan as this is more house than we need and we plan to downsize when we get older and the kids leave and the dream is to buy 2 places with one abroad. \n",
      "-\thowever the cost of housing is still a fair proportion of our income, and the equity in the property is a fair proportion of our net worth. \n",
      "-\tThis has also opened up other options I never thought of now as our LTV is about 30% vs 75% when we moved in…. 1) extending the mortgage term to reduce payments but increasing pension payments which means I’ll be much better off when I come to retire. 2) releasing some equity to reinvest in Buy to Let’s. 3) if all else fails we could sell up and buy a smaller house outright with the equity\n",
      "-\tIn reality we’ve also ended up with fairly big lifestyle inflation by moving. I’m not sure if we thought we would but we have and financially if we’d stayed where we were the house would probably have been paid off and we would have much more disposable income. But this wasn’t only a financially driven move…\n",

      "Happiness\n",
      "-\tWe don’t ever regret moving, we have more space which has really improved our lives so so much, having more space is amazing and has improved our standard of living so much (We have guests visit and we’re not tripping over each other, we don’t have neighbours so close etc)\n",
      "-\twe also feel we live in a much nicer area with a better community and place for our kids to grow up, whilst it’s much quieter, for the last 10 years with young kids we wouldn’t have used the amenities of the city \n",

      "Most etf products became available after 2008 crash. With world economies printing money since then it has been an easy ride to make returns. The argument in this market turmoil is how will we exit this. The US fed is set to start quantitative tightening next month removing trillions from the markets while countering inflation and uncertainty in bond markets by increasing rates. This is restricting growth as well as increasing cost of living leading to what people are calling stagflation. On the other hand China are starting to continue QE and prop their economy by building infrastructure all while damaging their gdp output with covid lockdowns. Macroeconomists see this approach as having little effect on chinas gdp because they have industrialised and modernised past a point where printing money and state funded projects provide a worthwhile investment without negative effect to cost of living. You also have Europe somewhere in the middle with negative rates but sitting in either camp of continuing QE or moving toward QT. The primary point is that the US economy will slow to weaken the USD and boost exports as China prints money and weakens their own economy to prop it up. Both sides are technically reducing GDP and as the big world economies we may see a slower regular return or loss like the the 2000 to 2007 period in s&amp;p500. Buying at the peak of 2000 Dotcom bubble and not selling in 2007 would have left you holding until 2012 to see a return. Averaging is a way to account for these ups and downs but how long you can stomach losing money is another question. This could be a couple years of seeing losses before any recovery in your money. We could see US turn tail and start QE and see another exit like 2008 which made markets are making a stable return but heading towards another bubble.

But you might get more if you extend the term etc. If you took the approach above and overpaid £300 per month every month your borrowing would come down to about 205k by end of year 6.

This also means that if we have kids and she wants to stay at home, we could manage on one salary and still have a bit of breathing space.

Apple currently has a PE ratio of about 27, which means that the stock costs $27 for every $1 of profits (strictly speaking *earnings*) the company made last year. Gazprom today has a PE ratio below 3, which means that the same $27 invested in the Russian company buys you about $10 of its earnings. Since the whole point of companies is to earn profits and pay them to their shareholders, you would seem to get more profits for your money by buying Gazprom.

By deferring the tax treatment, you have effectively increased your personal allowance.

The general advice is to invest a percentage equal to half your age when you start, so to force a 22-year-old to save 12% when 11% or perhaps even less will do is just silly. It becomes even sillier if you reduce the auto-enrolment age to 18, where 9% would suffice. Having said that, individuals can still opt out, so if I were 18 years old and being told \"you need to invest 12% minimum in a pension\", but didn't have a high enough income for me to justify getting rid of 7% of my gross income, I would just opt out and save independently until I reached age 24, at which point I would opt back in.\n",

At 50 years old, you have 10 years left until you can access your LISA/Pension, and 10 years worth of money left, no problem. But if the market then crashes 50%, suddenly you're about to run out of money at 55 with 5 years year to go until you can access the rest of your money.

      "Great question and thank you so much for asking. At the time it was a capital appreciation play as I tried to put my money into a market that would appreciate quickly and following the 18 year property cycle. I saw this as a way to park and hopefully increase our funds. The rent was ideally a way to offset inflation and cover our costs when management. I was early on in my investing career and this was more of a gamble although an exceedingly carefully researches one. But it paid off gangbusters. That one house increased by just shy of 50% in value in 4 years which gave us the funds for a home of our own and three modest but great yielding BTLs. In the 4 year interim I spent months and months researching the best market in the UK to invest in that was closest to where we planned to live and settled on Greater Manchester. Again this research has really paid off as the yeilds are consistently fantastic and capital appreciation has been great. I invest in lower priced house (but not the lowest) looking for areas with great fundamentals and on the up. I renovate the properties myself and self manage them as we take great care in tenant selection and building careful relationship. The portfolio has grown to 6 (aggressive saving/family help) and will be 9 by the end of the year with equity release. Yes it is work but so much less when the properties are ready and let. Then it is as close to passive leveraged investment as I am comfortable with. It is a business and tenants are your customers, if you don't treat then as such it will bite you in the ass.\n",

Higher inflation has historically hurt stock returns too, so folks need to be very careful about thinking that moving money out of cash savings and into investments is the best way to respond to a high inflationary environment. Indeed, investors tend to anticipate higher inflation by buying commodities rather than equities. Honestly, I think for the vast majority of people the best strategy is to stick to basics: short term financial goals and emergency fund in cash, long term goals in investments. High inflation is definitely going to hurt cash and probably going to hurt equities, but that's just something you have to try to live with really.

The laws of supply and demand would suggest that the price of labour ought to be going up just as the prices of everything else in short supply should be going up. *In practice* however such pay rises will probably only be enjoyed in a very small number of sectors whose workforces are in a position to bargain for them. It's beyond the remit of the sub to discuss here, but for people's own interest it's worth reading up on the various discussion around a so-called \"wage-price special\" and the kinds of measures that are being taken to ensure labour can be sold below what might be considered a \"fair market value\", while commodity prices are allowed to rise much more unencumbered to whatever level companies can sell them for.\n",

What strikes me is the enormous rise in the cost of living (inflation); this is terrible for an economy like ours where a major driver of growth is increasing household consumption. When people spend more of their budget on essentials, than they're forced to cut back on discretionary spending (aka, the non  essentials). At the same time, the bank of England has to raise interest rates to counter this run away inflation as is their remit.

Same applies for removals fees, solicitor fees, estate agent costs when you sell, etc. Then you've got to consider you'll need cash to pay stamp duty if you move on, and that takes time to save, along with any additional deposit you might want or need. There's also the fact that if you go for a fixed rate mortgage, you'll be hit with an early repayment charge (a % of the outstanding amount to be repaid) if you pay it off by selling within the fixed rate period, and lots of people go for 5 year fixes, though shorter periods are available.\n",

      "An annuity is a type of pension payment; I mentioned them in a previous comment. You hand over a sum of money to an insurance company, and they invest it and pay you back an annual amount (usually divided into monthly payments) for the agreed term, which can be a set number of years (usually in increments of 5), or for the rest of your life. For a lifetime annuity, the insurance company is basically betting that you'll live a certain number of years and they'll adjust the amount paid out to suit. An annuity has the advantage of being a known amount paid out, but it has two major disadvantages. First, the sums returned are really not very good and haven't been for many years; £100,000 will buy you an annuity of about £5193 a year ([https://www.hl.co.uk/retirement/annuities/best-buy-rates](https://www.hl.co.uk/retirement/annuities/best-buy-rates)) with no increase for inflation. \n",

Now she might live much longer than that; I knew a lady of 97 who got way more back than she paid in, but on average, the insurance company will win.

We have the UK budget this week and chinas property companies will be declaring their profits to Hong Kong exchange. The costs are going to start passing onto consumers more in taxes and these inflation periods. Rates rises with more base costs equals more delinquency. Less people in homes or buying them has a turn down on other major sectors. We are not at a bottom because of a lot of indicators really. We are struggling with employers filling roles and lots of easily available cash. It might continue but I am waiting at least a few months. House properties in where I used to live in the UK are up 20% in two years and not really reflecting the market. After the budget we may see the people who upgraded during covid trying to downsize if it isn’t shifting on things like NI increase. It is already a bear market and all known hedges are high in price. There is no harm in just having a 30/30/30 split in bonds, equities and cash until you study a bit more and see what happens. Maybe use some of your cash to gamble on these things like record costs leading to concerned farmers leading to no more new John Deere tractors.

Even crypto is looking crazy right now and tether is ready to reset that market or potentially high earnings from the sanctions going around. People are moving out large amounts to private wallets but is that because they are long as a hedge against the market or they are concerned news on tether will crash the market and potentially the exchanges as the China situation worsens.

As a result, while there were 660,000 more dwellings than households in England in 1996, this surplus has since grown to over 1.1 million by 2018. Similar trends are apparent in Scotland and Wales.

The established theory of house price formation tells us that changes are determined by a combination of market rents and the cost of capital. So house prices can jump or crash in response to shifts in the main components of the cost of capital: mortgage interest rates, taxes, and expectations of future price growth. Such volatility can occur even when rents are stable.\n",

So really the question you should be asking is whether in one and two years’ time you’re going to have more nominal pounds in your pocket at the end of each month with which to make your loan repayments, which would make the debt in real-terms more affordable to service for you. Because all you can really say if the 3% APR is less than headline inflation is that this particular debt isn’t growing as fast as the overall price rise of the basket of goods and services that constitutes the measure of inflation, which doesn’t then mean that the loan is getting cheaper for you to pay off in real terms.\n",

Assuming your membership started after April 2014, it's 1/49th of your pensionable pay. ie. one year of membership when your pensionable salary is £40k would mean that in retirement, you have accrued a pension of 1/49 x £40k = £816 per annum.

The cost to you is based on what your contributions are, and your contribution % is based on where you fall on the salary bandings for the scheme, which is between 5% and 15% if I remember correctly. So if to get one year, you contribute 10%, you'll pay another 10% to get an additional year.\n",

      "\\- Additional voluntary contributions, which goes into what is kinda like a little defined contribution pension tacked on to the LGPS fund. The value of the AVCs is based on what you put in, plus growth. Some funds manage them directly, others engage a provider like Legal &amp; General or Prudential or whoever to manage the AVCs. You can use it to top-up the pension from LGPS, buy an annuity, stuff like that.\n",

There will obviously also be shifts in supply chains and food production but none of these will be insurmountable (though we are likely to end up more dependent on Russia for our calories). \n",

Even other pensions are actually backed by the government anyway fwiw as there are very strict laws governing them and the government will bail out pensions that fail (and remember, the government literally has unlimited money to do this).

      "\n",
      "Consider that in any extreme scenario the government can already legislate to ban you taking money from ISAs or bank accounts so the only safe option in that case is cash. And even cash isn't safe because the government can legislate to immediately make all bank notes invalid, and issue new ones in their place. Don't believe me?

If you want to invest in a high inflation scenario, I would look at companies which have competitive advantages over their competitors. I’m talking your Coca Cola, your apple, NVIDIA, so on.

High dividend companies tend to pay 3-6% of the money you invested in them throughout the year, so the idea is you invest a bit every month and reinforce your position. If recession scares you, consider doing dividend investment across several markets! You can do a bit in the US, a bit in the UK, a bit in Europe, etc. China has really good companies but eh, kinda scary right now \n",

But most importantly you are sacrificing some of your capital to be locked into a deposit. You are therefore forgoing any return from investing that (or at least the difference between returns elsewhere and house price growth).

For most banks NIM dominates.  NIM expands as central bank rates rises, as deposits increase at a slower rate and by less.  Whereas lending rates tend to move instantly for all commercial lending, and any new lending written (albeit not existing fixed mortgages).

And why are you turning your nose up at a free £1000 per year? 14k if you and your partner max out the LISA for 7 years? Also look into the LISA rules, they don’t have to be used for a house. You can use it for retirement and still get the 25% bonus. \n",

Then add a rate rise and many people will be in trouble because the bank let them borrow, so believed they could afford it.\n",

      "Using the assumptions here, if you have a 5% interest rate, then it might take 30 years to triple or whatever - and sure, that amount of money isn't going to have the same purchasing power as today.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, if inflation was also 5%, then that tripled amount of money in 30 years will still have exactly the same buying power as it the invested sum does today. The compound interest cancels out the inflation. Therefore, the compound interest is more about protecting your purchasing power from being eroded, rather than growing your money only to see that sum having been eroded by inflation. It's just a matter of how you frame it in your head.\n",
      "\n",
      "If inflation is higher than the interest rate of your investment, you will still lose purchasing power on that sum, but less than you would if you did something with that sum with a smaller interest rate.\n",

      "If inflation is lower than the interest rate, then not only are you protecting against inflation, you are also gaining something while you are at it. Maybe not a huge gain, but some gain is surely better than nothing, and is even better than losing something!\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, if you have something that is genuinely a better use of your money, you might as well do that. But if you don't have anything better to do, you might as well invest it where it has a good chance of being protected against erosion by inflation, and compound interest is what usually achieves that.\n",
      "---\n",
      "When you say it hasn't got the buying power, you're talking about inflation. Imagine your stock portfolio averages a 5% annual return over 10 years and inflation averages 2% over those years. In this case, your money has grown faster than the price of things has increased, so overall you're better off.\n",
      "\n",
      "Technically, you're right that we can never know that returns on different investments will be higher than inflation. But this seems incredibly unlikely for a number of reasons too complex for here. Also note that in developed economies governments target low inflation, typically 2-4% and so will put a lot of effort into ensuring it's not higher than this, so the judgement becomes: \"how likely are my investments to return over 4% annually?\". This has basically always happened, though the standard caveat applies here: past performance is no guarantee of future performance.\n",

      "But given that most businesses fail, and a failed business is basically like an investment that returns 0, investing in your own business can be thought of as a high risk, high reward strategy.

      "So far, the super saver has amassed £436,000 in assets, which includes £20,000 in Premium Bonds, £42,000 in a stocks and shares Isa, £714 in cryptocurrencies, £53,000 in his pension and money tied up in his residential and buy-to-let properties. \n",

The low cost of living in the Spanish city, which he compared to Manchester’s average cost, will help stretch his income.\n",

It generates an income of £150 a month for each of them, after paying the mortgage and towards a contingency fund. “It’s not a huge amount, but it’s a start,” he said.\n",

      "He estimated he would need between seven and 10 jointly-owned properties, or five that he owns outright, to meet his target income. “The more, the better because there’s less risk. You aren’t as dependent on there being tenants in there every month,” he said. \n",

There is another thread on the forum about £100 not buying what it used to and lots of people saying that in 2008 you could buy pints for £1.80 and even as low as £1, it's a very different story nowadays. More importantly what inflation can do is potentially make things unavailable. So you may not buy the most expensive things but there may be a time where a lot of food won't be available because it becomes too much to make. So it will limit what you eat if you are even able to get anything. Same with housing. Costs of houses are very expensive now and with that comes a lack of inventory. If people are looking for houses around my area there is very little around and that is partly to do with inflation. Any of your savings will be eroded away with your purchasing power diminished through a compounded inflation. Fuel is another killer as we have seen recently that's at an all time high in this country and with inflation it would be no surprise to see it creep up to the £2.

The UK has the sixth ish richest economy on the planet. We have low corporate tax rates and it is easy to mitigate taxation as a corporate entity or high earner. We spent the best part of a decade after 2008 recapitalising financial institutions only to see the vast majority of that money be squirreled away into the pockets of those who already were asset rich.

Thankfully your cash just remained the same value, if it only made 10% then you actually didn't beat real inflation and you cash is worth less now...technically you in the minus basically without realising it!\n",

If someone were to buy now they might see themselves in negative equity if the pound goes down in value and there is less demand, but then again, they may not if they lock in a lower interest rate on their mortgage comparable to future ones. Right now you are seeing a cash flight in the stock and crypto market because of the uncertainty slung up by inflation, partly to do with supply chains, Covid, too much printing of cash.

People don't like seeking a flat for less than it was bought, so they hold out, but over time prices reduce.\n",

So if you expect inflation to come back under control in a year or two, you shouldn't assume that the compounding will last forever.\n",

Admittedly you don't know exactly what that cap is because you can't forecast your future earnings, but let's play with some numbers. Let's assume that your average salary over the 30 years from graduation is an optimistic £100k per year. That's about 75k above the threshold, times 30 years times 9% means your total repayments would be around £200k. If your starting debt was £50k, the maximum you'll repay is 4 times what you borrowed. 4^((1/30)) = 1.047, so we're looking at an effective interest rate of 4.7% per year. \n",

Should you aggressively repay a 5% interest debt? Maybe. But if you wouldn't, you probably shouldn't aggressively repay the student loan even if the nominal rate went to 10% or even higher.\n",

Nice having a physical asset that could be easily transported and sold if needed. And it’s shiny. Option of passing it onto kids one day. \n",

You can buy physical gold and vault it, where someone else stores it for you, here you pay for the storage and, I guess trust they have you gold. Or you can buy physical gold in person or online and have it sent to your house. \n",

So far what I have is worth more than I paid for it. And I’d recommend it as part of a balanced approach to asset management/investment.\n",
      "---\n",
      "Gold is interesting. In Roman times, an ounce bought a suit of clothes for a gentleman. It also did during Victorian times. Today, I see an ounce of gold is about €1,740, which isn’t outlandish for a suit, especially a handmade one which, historically,  they all were. The point is, any given quantity of gold has always had roughly the same purchasing power at any time over for over 2,000 years. It should be thought of as a store of rather than a generator of wealth. In fact, the day you buy it, you lose value due to the spread (the difference between the market buy and sell price). But over time, the value of the cash you used to buy the gold falls (inflation), while the purchasing power of the gold is retained. But in normal circumstances, there’s a big opportunity cost in buying gold instead of, for example, property or an ETF which can normally be relied on to both protect your original purchasing power while also generating a return. Gold protects your wealth’s real value but that’s literally all it does - it generates nothing for you.\n",

      "The money is stranded and earning zero. But it's allowing cashflow that would otherwise be spent on the monthly lease payment. That cashflow can be monthly DCA invested instead of lump sum invested. \n",

      "\n",
      "I'm all for cheap debt financing such as PCP and lease when there are higher returns available. But the lease versus depreciation numbers are heavily in favour of ownership and (small) depreciation right now. 2 year old Model 3s are going for well below £10K depreciation (I've heard of some people selling their 2 year old Model 3 for less than £1K below what they paid - aided by the OLEV grant, of course). The lease in that time period would have been close to around £15K+ typically (hard to give exact values, of course, because of several factors).\n",

Now, the Fed is kicking into gear and things have changed for the UK with electricity prices.

      "2.\tThe annual rent in London is around 4% of the property purchase prices. I’d add that the rental yield is important, because the higher it is, the same pound borrowed to buy a property saves you more rent. The rental yield in London is very low.\r",
      "  \n",

Diversification is widely recognized as the best way to protect your wealth while growing it. I’ll add to this that investing in London leaves you even more undiversified because property purchase costs take a disproportionate share of Londoners’ incomes.\r",

      "  \n",
      "I have seen some points, supporting the \"buy in London now\" view:\r",
      "  \n",
      "1.\tStatement: When you rent, you own nothing. My view: You own the capital gains and dividends on the shares. And more importantly, you own a diversified portfolio. From a pure personal finance view, any sensible investor would be willing to take a cut on their wealth for having a diversified portfolio compared to all the eggs in one basket. £10 in one house is not the same than £10 in the global economy. And from a personal risk management perspective, I'd argue that £15 in one house is worth much less than £10 in the global economy. Not everyone has to mirror my risk appetite, but diversification should be prominent in any serious personal finance discussion. \r",
      "  \n",
      "2.\tStatement: Mortgage fixes your payments, whereas rents track property prices, so you lose long term. My view: This is a good point, but may be overstated. Data shows that the property market almost always hedges well against inflation over long holding periods (20+ years). But more than that? That’s debatable. Now, because inflation generally increases over time, by simply tracking inflation, rents increase over time. Mortgages don’t, so sooner or later rent may exceed mortgage repayments (more on this below). \r",
      "  \n",
      "3.\tStatement: Your monthly mortgage cost is lower than your rent. My view: it really depends on the terms you agree, such as interest rates, downpayments, mortgage repayment period, and whether you want to take on an interest only mortgage, and then on your additional ownership costs. If you are running a dynamic analysis looking at a 30-year horizon, at some point renting will become more expensive than ongoing ownership costs. Some people say interest rates are below 2%. That's been surprising so I'm happy I opened this thread, I have not seen this and will look more into it.\r",
      "  \n",
      "4.\tSome people think that flat maintenance costs less than 1% of its value a year, and that’s Ok, I am happy to correct the numbers if the typical flat’s upkeep is less than 1%. However, I do note that I have visited newbuilds in London with very high service charges, so 1% is definitely not unseen. A lot of people are locked in flats paying over £5K a year, in service charges alone. \r",
      "  \n",
      "5.\tStatement: Landlords make money out of tenants, not the other way around. My view: That does not prove anything. There are many sophisticated property investors, with access to tools that either I can’t, or wouldn’t, use. For example, important economies of scale unavailable to the average Joe. So it can be true both that a landlord makes money out of my tenancy and I also 'make' money from the tenancy simply because of the frictions that I face, and the landlord doesn't, from entering the property market as a buyer. There are also other types of landlords that have been lucky, because they needed large property price appreciation or a sustained low interest rate environment and the tide turned in their favour, and that I may not expect to have. Needless to say, letting prices are not determined as mark-ups of a landlords' cost, it's supply and demand. Some landlords accept a negative cash flow, even if temporary, because it fits their goals. \r",
      "  \n",
      "6.\tStatement: It is best to use money for a downpayment than investing in stocks because mortgages offer levered returns. My view: This is another good point. And the higher the % you borrow, the higher the levered returns generally… if things go well. However, borrowing too much is also a thing. 95% leverage? You are playing with fire. Forget everything else you read and walk away with this: You are playing with fire. With London prices, it is easier to be overlevered because property prices are very high compared to incomes. With inflation currently galloping, large interest rate increases, like a 3 percentage points increase, are possible and can be a real problem if people borrow too much.\n",

Changes have happened in the past but benefits up to the changes have been protected.\n",

      "The transfer has time constraints for it to be completed (I think 1 year from joining an eligible job). This is something to keep in mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that you are early 30s you have time on your side. What I mean by this is that your private pension does have the chance for it to grow above and beyond the required rate of return needed to match the 8k a year.\n",

      "**Convenience/Flexibility**  \n",
      "Transferring you pension into the DB scheme allows you to have all your pensions in one place which is convenient and doesn't require you to really make any further decisions. Additionally at retirement you don't need to plan how and which pension to draw from, worry about which form to receive a pension (e.g an annuity, flexible drawdown etc.)\n",

The two things you would need to estimate would be the rate of return one would expect to receive over the long run in your pension and the date in which you will want to access the pension. For comparison sake I would use your retirement age minus current age.\n",

      "You have a pretty modest size private pension that could be used in the future in a more flexible way than a DB scheme. So if you are comfortable with knowing the risks then I think this provides you with a great opportunity to meet certain financial goals and freedoms in the future.

Does a 40% World Equity fund with a 60% World Bond fund have the same characteristics as a 50% World Equity fund and a 50% Developed World Government bond fund. No, this is because poor credit quality bonds are correlated to equity.\n",

      "8) Low interest rate environments. Over the past several decades there has been a drift downwards in central bank interest rates. People have gotten used to this, and now it maybe coming to an end, future expected returns on long duration bonds are seen as unattractive. This is the wrong mindset of how to look at bonds, they are not there to make you rich, they are there to lower volatility. (If the equity market goes down for three years in a row, suddenly, holding onto a bond fund that pays out 2% guaranteed per year is extremely smart). Also if interest rates go up, your bond fund will be buying those newly issued bonds up and integrating them into the fund.\n",
      "\n",
      "9) Price of bond funds vs yield. The two are fundamentally correlated. When a bond fund price unit goes up in value it is because the current yields have gone down. If yields go up, the price of the bond fund goes down. Like the equity market, timing the market doesn't work and the same is true for the bond market, you cannot time it.\n",

      "- Secondly, it’s become a common narrative that somehow employers are obligated to offset the effect of inflation when they give payrises. This is really not a sensible argument. I mean of course it is true that the real costs of living are going up for everyone, and that employers should care about that, but a lot of those costs are also going up for businesses too, so just because inflation is 7% doesn’t magically mean that we suddenly have 7% more money to pay people. In the current situation particularly, where this inflation is being caused in large part by supply constraints, it may be the case that your business has less money to spend than before. So it’s not really possible to assess whether a payrise is fair on a general scale, this is really down ti you, your role and your company.\n",

I think a lot of companies are going to have a huge reality check once they realise how much talent they lose and how many spaces they need to fill once people go elsewhere for a similar job that pays 5-10k more.

      "Inflation is at 30 year highs and increasingly seems likely to be persistent/reinforcing for a while.  Meanwhile Central Banks, particularly US/UK are signaling a rapid series of rate rises across this year and beyond.  My hypothesis is that political pressure ‘to do something’ will mean Central Banks rise rates too fast, meanwhile this will have limited impact on inflation itself given this is being driven by supply chain disruption and raw commodity prices (albeit it is now starting to feedthrough secondary/tertiary industries due to wage inflation).  So the end result is a rapid reduction in debt financing costs with an ongoing inflation issue meaning we will see sizeable reductions in disposable income for consumers and profit margins for companies.  Lower profit margins and debt affordability will drive lower asset prices (stocks and housing), which will lower consumer confidence, further curtailing discretionary spending, resulting in a weaker job market, thereby reducing disposable incomes further.  We’ve then got a death spiral  until a recession bottoms out.\n",

      "Finally I’m just going to pre-empt a counter argument that I expect to hear.  “That the playbook to counter inflation is to increase rates, exactly for the purpose of reducing disposable income”.  I agree, but this is the playbook for demand driven inflation.  What we have is a mix of supply constrained inflation and commodity driven inflation.  Increasing interest rates is not going to make more micro chips, or get container shipping back in order.  Equally it’s not going to get OPEC to open the oil taps.  The big inflation increases in food and energy and not exactly something you can drive down much on the demand side with higher interest rates.\n",

However, I recently started paying an extra £150 a month towards it, that I'm now saving on rent from my girlfriend moving in, and I also add in any profits I make from matched betting each month (usually around £100-200). All this adds up to about £500, give or take, a month being repaid and puts me on track to be paid off in about 1.5 years.\n",

I've also maxed out my ISA contributions for the year so any additional savings I have go into a standard savings account, which like all the others, has terrible interest rates so this isn't exactly resilient to inflation either. \n",

Would this be beneficial considering current inflation rates? If the money is losing value every month sitting as premium bonds, then it makes sense to get more value out of it while I can. Having said that though, inflation also will be eating away at my student loan, meaning that I repay less than I borrowed in real terms - so I'm not sure which is the better option for me\n",

      "In order to calculate this I need to make some assumptions, firstly I will calculate everything in todays money to make it easier to deal with inflation. Secondly I will calculate it for 4 starting amounts (the amount of debt you have when you are first eligible to repay it) of £40k, £50k, £60k and £70k as I think these are the most common amounts of student and roughly correspond to a 3 year course with minimum maintenance to a 4 year course with maximum maintenance. If you have less than about £40k debt at the start of the 30 years congratulations it's actually a bit easier for you as the income required to pay it all back over the 30 years will mean the interest due on the debt is less than RPI +3%. I'm also assuming you earn the same amount throughout the entire 30 year period, I will come back to this assumption later.\n",

I personally mentally add about £5k-£10k to the above figures to account for this but this isn't an exact science and do your own calculations/research please.\n",

Additionally, you have to pay for an extra 10 years so 40 years total. I'm not saying which is better, I don't know, you also don't get a choice as to which system you pay under.

I contribute the maximum of £4K each tax year and get a 25% Government bonus each tax year from it which is £1k per tax year. Generally people say stocks should be a long term investment (5+ years) so if I add £4K in this tax year the stocks might not perform well in the short term.

I thought to myself.... if I use the LISA towards a house deposit, then it would be used forever and I won't be able to use it for retirement. However, if perhaps my parents would be extremely kind (big if) to contribute what I have in my LISA, then I can continue to use my LISA every single year until retirement. Assuming I manage to save away £4k each tax year, that means I'll be getting £1k each tax year for the rest of my life. I realise the risk that if a crisis comes into my life let's say in 20 years, I can't then take money out of this LISA so there's an element of risk attached. **Do you think using a LISA for retirement is far better than using it for a first time house purchase?**\n",
