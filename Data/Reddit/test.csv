I agree with your comments. Would only add that OP could get a LISA if he invests up to £4k and get a 25% bonus towards a first home or retirement. So even if the interest on the student loan is high that would still be worth doing compared to paying it off.

Some people will tell you ""don't invest unless it is for at least 5-10 years"" but that is frankly complete hogwash. 

If you invest over a short time period, you are very likely to make a profit. The issue is that you could also make a loss - as there is less time for good years and bad years to average out. The decision you need to make is whether you are happy to accept the risk of your investment going down in value in return for the reward of the more likely scenario that it increases in value. That is a personal decision that depends on your personal financial situation.

Obviously you cannot avoid all risk entirely, since with cash savings and premium bonds you are facing inflation risk, and shortfall risk (i.e. the risk of house prices rising faster than your deposit). 

In your situation, personally I would consider putting my savings (except for the LISA) into lower or medium risk investment funds, where you should get some return but face lower risk than a 100% equity investment fund.

2. There is no ‘pot of money’ that’s left over when you die. Contrast this to a self-invested pension, in which case your children will inherit your pot tax-free. There are small amounts paid out in spousal/children’s pension payments but the capital is lost to them. Passing on SIPPs is extremely tax efficient.
3. For high-earners, there are risks in how the pension is calculated vs annual allowance. See the BMA’ Tony Goldstone for more info. Essentially you may be at risk of a significant tax hit in later years.
4. Your NHS pension is at risk. I.e. if you are involved and convicted of gross misconduct etc, it’s possible that your NHS pension is forfeit.
