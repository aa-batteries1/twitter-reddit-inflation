MSc Applied Social Data Science thesis: Forecasting US Inflation using Twitter and Reddit Data

This paper aims to investigate the relationship between inflation-related narratives and changes in US inflation
expectations in the social media age, given both the proliferation of social media in the last decade
and the lack of discussion in the literature about the impact that this exponentially increased interconnectedness
between individual economic agents can have on inflation expectations. On this topic, the existing
literature finds that the media do have a strong influence on consumer inflation expectations. However,
there is little consideration for the impact social media in particular, a key driver of actions many people take
within the real-world, has. Hence, I seek to add to the literature in this way by generating sentiment and
attention indicators relating to inflation from posts on both Twitter and Reddit. These are then employed
in similar methodologies applied, for example, in investigations into how tweets have moved certain equity
and cryptocurrency markets recently, in order to generate inflation expectation forecasts. Testing various
model architectures out-of-sample indicates that incorporating social media content allows for increases in
forecast accuracy. As such, the metrics generated from social media data provide a new-age resource for
policymakers in their quest to accurately forecast inflation in the 21st century.
